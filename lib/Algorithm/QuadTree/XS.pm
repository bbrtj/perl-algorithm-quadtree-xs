=head1 NAME

Algorithm::QuadTree::XS - XS backend for Algorithm::QuadTree

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Algorithm::QuadTree;

  # Algorithm::QuadTree::XS will be used automatically if it is available

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution contains XS implementation of quadtrees.

This implementation is compatible with C<Algorithm::QuadTree::PP>. Benchmarks
on author's machine show it runs at least five times faster (depending on the
tree depth).

B<Beta quality>: while this module works well in general cases, it may also contain errors common to C code like memory leaks or access violations. Please do report if you encounter any problems.
